This is an attempt to create a cross-platform media player with [F#], [Avalonia], and [Avalonia.FuncUI]

I already have a sample of a desktop based media player with Avalonia.FuncUI so I know it's possible

This repository will explorer how to handle multiplatform stuff, for example LibVLCSharp has different packages depending if you're targeting android and desktop (among other platforms like uwp or xamarin forms).

So bear with me while this gets in a relatively good shape
